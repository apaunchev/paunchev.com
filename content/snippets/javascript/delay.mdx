To artificially delay execution of some code you can use a combination of a `Promise` and `setTimeout`.

```javascript
const delay = duration => new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, duration));
```

Usage:

```javascript
const handleAction = async () => {
  // Do something
  await delay(2000);
  // Do something
};
```
