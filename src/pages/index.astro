      Hello, I’m Angel—a software engineer from Bulgaria who turns ambitious
      ideas into reality.
    </h1>
    <p>
      I’ve been deeply invested in computers and technology since I was in
      school. What used to be just a hobby turned into my field of study, then
      into my career.
    </p>
    <p>
      At present, I work as a front-end engineer and try to build easy-to-use
      and resilient interfaces for the web. My tools of the trade include modern
      JavaScript and CSS. I like to actively participate in the full product
      lifecycle—from early concept, through technical design, to delivering and
      maintaining the finished product. I’m also responsible for growing and
      mentoring a team of engineers. See{" "}
